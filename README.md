**Problem: Detect the Distress silently and send alerts!**

In a group of people, when the person is alone, followed by someone, kidnapping, domestic violence or elder falls at home, In these situations this project will help us by detecting the reaction of the person and the hand signs of the person will be detected in the camera and predict the reaction of the person who is not comfortable or in any distress situation then the camera detects and send  the alert message to the owner of the camera or the  nearby police station if they are in any of the mode like  online mode  then the alert message will send through email and screenshot will be shared to the  owner or the nearby pc, if in the offline mode the alert message will be sent through the beep sound for the local people to understand both will be send in the same time to act faster. 

**WHY?**

We have choosen  this project because most of the ladies they feel  uncomfortable to travel alone or with the uncomfortable people they can't explain their feelings by words so when the person is  in uncomfortable situation or threatening situation this may help them, 70% of the reports are going unreported  due to the lack of knowledge of people even though there is camera but they couldn't detected. For instance few days before they  was incident happened in Coimbatore where  they couldn't find the person who killed the girl so if there was a camera with a detection system it could have sent the alert message or the beep sound immediately, so that the police could've went to the place and a life would have been saved so this is the reason why we are building this. The police informed that if they reach the location before 10 minutes they could have they could have save the life so at this situation we think our project will be very helpful. Along with that the main reason we have  created this project is for our nilgiris where we have many tourist spots where the women doesn't feel comfortable around many men so that we can place the cctv cameras in the tea stalls or shops, starting from our own local areas  after that one by one we are trying to work it over all the places and to reach many people and also will give awareness about the sign language and the face reactions through the camera so that the people will known  and when they need help they can show their  hand signs and their face reactions which can be predicted by the camera and give the alerts.

**HOW IT WORKS?**

Capturing through the camera of the face reactions (FER) or the hand signals (media pipe) using open CV,
Through the camera it will be capturing two types like mediapipe and FER through the media pipe we can make they hand tracking (sign languages) and through the FER we can predict the emotions of the person after completing the predictions then the beep sound will be enabled and a alert message and the screenshot will be sent to the owner of the camera or the nearby police station through a mail. The email is sent using Python SMTP

**CHALLENGES:**

Performance, Lower resolutions, Random facial detection or hand signals detection, Poor Lighting 

**FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:**

Connection with CCTV Cameras, More advanced facial detection, Works in any kind of lighting, The alert message can be sent to the police station or cyber crime
